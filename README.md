# Lights Out plugin for JW Player

Lights Out is a javascript plugin for the JW player that basically turns off the lights in the background and lets the users focus on the media in the JW player. The lights out functionality causes the browser window (with the exception of the JW player) to be overlayed with a background shade with customizable color and opacity.
